// FileWriteService.h
//
// This service provides a simple queued file writing mechanism.  It
// accepts requests to persist arbitrary strings to a given path on the
// LittleFS filesystem and processes them one at a time in the main
// loop.  By deferring writes outside of HTTP request handlers and
// executing them serially, we avoid long blocking operations that
// could trigger the watchdog or cause reboots.  The service writes to
// a temporary file and renames it to ensure atomicity.  Pending
// entries can be queried via a web API to aid debugging.

  // pending it is not deduplicated â€“ both writes will happen in
